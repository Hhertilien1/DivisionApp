Herby Hertilien, COP3330-24680, Division App
This application is a simple division calculator that accepts 2 integer inputs from a user and forms a division problem. 
This calculates the quotient of the 2 numbers and outputs the quotient to the user. 
Plans in the future to allow user to do multiple functions but for now it only calculated division.
