Herby Hertilien, COP3330-24680, Division App
This application is a simple division calculator that accepts 2 integer inputs from a user and forms a division problem. 
This has a method that calculates the quotient of the 2 numbers and outputs the quotient to the user. 
This project also includes error handling for situations where user tries to input an invalid division problem. 
Plans in the future to allow user to do multiple functions but for now it only calculates division.
